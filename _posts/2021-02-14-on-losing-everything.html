        <p>The first time it happened, I was five hours into a highway drive south to see my parents.</p>
        
        <p>The sirens flashed behind me. I pulled over. The police officer took his time approaching.</p>
        
        <p>“I’m afraid we’ll have to impound your car.”</p>
        
        <p>I couldn’t believe it.</p>
        
        <p>“What? Why?”</p>
        
        <p>“Rental company called. You passed the 500-kilometre daily limit.”</p>
        
        <p>I looked at the dashboard. The trip meter read 501.</p>
        
        <p>“How can that be? It’s a rental!”</p>
        
        <p>“Have you read the terms and conditions? Clearly says so in the fine print.”</p>
        
        <p>He gave me a printout of the car rental agreement.</p>
        
        <p>“What the fuck?”</p>
        
        <p>The second time it happened, my car was being taken away by a tow truck. The landlord called.</p>
        
        <p>“I just emailed you an eviction notice, effective immediately. Your stuff is in the shed outside.”</p>
        
        <p>I couldn’t believe it.</p>
        
        <p>“What? Why?”</p>
        
        <p>“Utility company called. You passed the 500-kWh monthly limit.”</p>
        
        <p>I checked my email. The meter statement read 501.</p>
        
        <p>“How can that be? It’s a rental!”</p>
        
        <p>“Have you read the terms and conditions? Clearly says so in the fine print. Anyway, I’ve already listed your apartment online for double the rent.”</p>
        
        <p>“What the actual fuck?”</p>
        
        <p>The third time it happened, I’d just hung up the phone and immediately got another call from the airline.</p>
        
        <p>“We cancelled your return flight.”</p>
        
        <p>I couldn’t believe it.</p>
        
        <p>“What? Why?”</p>
        
        <p>“Our records show that you skipped your departing flight today, so we’ve cancelled the return flight as well.”</p>
        
        <p>I’d rented the car last minute but planned to fly back.</p>
        
        <p>“How can that be? I paid for the whole trip.”</p>
        
        <p>“Have you read the terms and conditions? Clearly says in the fine print that this is what we do.”</p>

        <p>“Un-fucking-believable.”</p>
        
        <p>The fourth time it happened, I was trying to call a cab. The call cut off, and I received a text from the phone company.</p>
        
        <p>“We’re sorry to inform you that, as per the fine print in the terms and conditions, we’ve terminated your contract due to excessive roaming.”</p>
        
        <p>I tried sending a middle-finger emoji back, but it failed to deliver.</p>
        
        <p>So here I am, sitting on a concrete divider in July heat with the terms and conditions in my hand. The ink is smudging under my fingers from the sweat. I start reading and can’t hold back laughing. What a stupid situation to find yourself in. What a stupid, stupid day.</p>
